BIG-Project

BIG-Project is a mobile app developed to fight bullying in schools.

You can log in as a "younger brother" or as an "older brother".

The younger brothers are the youngest students in the school. They can get an "older brohter", who is an older student from the school.

The brother will communicate through the app using the chat.

There is selfie option, which you can use to send photos between the brother. Clicking th bottom button below the photograph, you can get the main emotion of the person in the picture.

You can also find quizzs about bullying for the students.
